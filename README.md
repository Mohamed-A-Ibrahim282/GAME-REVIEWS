Project Overview
I've developed a dynamic game display platform using JavaScript and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project allows users to explore a variety of games and get detailed information about each game with just a click!

🎮 Features
Game Showcase: The platform presents a visually appealing display of various games, making it easy for users to browse through the collection.

Interactive UI: Thanks to JavaScript, the user interface is responsive and interactive. Smooth transitions and animations enhance the overall user experience.

Details on Demand: Click on any game, and Detailed information about the selected game appears on the screen.

Object-Oriented Magic: Leveraging the power of OOP, the codebase is modular and organized. Each game is represented as an object, making the project scalable and easy to maintain.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Programming Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
🚀 How It Works
Game Object Creation: Each game is represented as an object with properties like title, genre, description, and more.

Event Handling: Click events are handled efficiently, triggering the display of detailed information about the selected game without the need for page reloads.
